A large number of vehicles are stopped in toll plazas to pay tolls, causing traffic congestion. So, in order to alleviate these traffic jams, the Indian government introduced the FasTag payment system and mandated that all toll plazas in the country accept electronic payments.</span>

In today's blog post, we'll provide you a step-by-step guide to the fastag online process. So simply read the entire blog page to gain a thorough understanding of the situation.<br></span>


<h1 class="text-center font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">What exactly is FASTag?</h1>

<br><span>

FASTag is a type of tag that is attached to the vehicle's front side mirror to allow for automatic toll payment in toll plazas without the need for a cash transaction.


<br>

<br><span>

This is accomplished by the use of RFID technology on toll plazas, which automatically detects the <a href="https://https://tolltaxes.com/enquiry.php/" target="_blank">Fastag</a> on the Widescreen of vehicles going through the toll. For payment deduction, this tag is linked to the bank account of the vehicle's owner</span>

<br>

<br>

<h2 class="font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">How does FASTag work?</h2>

<br><span>

The FASTtag system collects electronic payment through that tag.Because the tag placed in front of the vehicle mirror is linked to a bank account of the person who owns the vehicle, This is accomplished by opening a <a href="https://https://tolltaxes.com/enquiry.php/" target="_blank">Fastag</a> account in your bank. You must frequently recharge your FASTag account in order for it to remain active.<br>


There is a system integrated with radio frequency identification technology in the toll plaza that automatically recognises the dag and collects payment without the use of currency.
