<br><span>

FASTag is a Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) that was adopted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of the Indian government in October 2017. This decision was made after considering a number of potential annoyances for both individual drivers and the country as a whole.

<br>

<br><span>

According to statistics cited in a Times of India article, India's toll booth plazas leak nearly Rs. 12000 crore each year. Fuel wastage and the exhaustion of human resources at toll plazas are two of the principal causes of such losses.
While the financial loss is the most pressing problem, another impact, namely air pollution, goes unnoticed.
India is one of the world's most polluted countries, with over 14 cities, including the nation's capital, Delhi, suffering from extraordinarily high levels of air pollution.In this aspect, Toll plazas have a significant role in India's increasing air pollution levels. As a result, one of the goals of implementing <a href="https://tolltaxes.com/" target="_blank">FASTag</a> in India was to reduce these levels.</span>

<br>

<h2 class="font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">How FASTag works?</h2>

<br><span>

FASTag is a radio frequency identification (RFID) system that functions in a similar way to other RFID systems. A RFID-enabled sticker is attached to a vehicle's windshield, and a reader at the toll booth may scan this card and process the payment electronically and automatically.
<br>

<br>

<h3 class="font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">Is it mandatory to have a FASTag?</h3>

<br><span>

Yes, it is required for everyone who drives a personal or commercial vehicle on a national roadway. If you are caught without a <a href="https://tolltaxes.com/" target="_blank">FASTag</a> you will be fined heavily.</span>
