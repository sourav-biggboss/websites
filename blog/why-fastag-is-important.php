<h1 class="text-center font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">Why FASTag is Important? </h1><br>
<span>FASTag has been gaining traction ever since it came into existence in India. Initiated by the <strong>Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MoRTH)</strong> in October, 2017, it was introduced as a solution to eliminate the concept of physical transaction at the toll booth. This solution turned out to be much more effective as it speeded up the vehicle movement at toll booths.<br><br>
 By October 2019, MoRTH had issued a notification to <strong>Central Motor Vehicle Rules (CMVR)</strong> that they make it <strong>mandatory</strong> for vehicles to own a FASTag in order to renew its fitness certificate.<br><br>
For customers purchasing new vehicles <strong><i>after</i> December 2017</strong>, it was crucial for them to have a FASTag, in order to get their vehicle registered. Dealers and manufacturers were themselves providing FASTag cards along with the new vehicle.<br><br>
 
FASTag is also becoming necessary for vehicles purchased <strong><i>before</i> December, 2017</strong>.<br>
According to the most recent announcement made in November, 2020 by the Ministry, all vehicles purchased before December 2017, should possess a FASTag card wef from <strong><font color="red">January, 2021</font></strong>. Additionally, there will be a deadline for all these vehicles to buy a FASTag card before <strong><font color="red">April, 2021</font></strong>.</span>
<br><br><br>
<h2 class="text-left font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">How does a FASTag work?</h2><br>
<span>FASTag is a card-like device affixed on the windscreen of your car which uses a <strong>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</strong> technology. While the vehicle passes through the toll booth, the card is automatically detected and scanned, debiting the required amount from your FASTag account.<br>
Presently FASTag is operational in <strong>407 toll booths</strong> across National and State highways of India.</span>
<br><br><br>
<h3 class="text-left font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">Benefits of FASTag</h3><br>
<span><ul>
<li>The major benefit of a FASTag is that it saves time and fuel. The vehicle can be mobile while the scanner deducts the required money from the FASTag and can pass through the toll booth in no time.</li><br>
<li>An sms alert will be given, once the transaction has been done.</li><br>
<li>Cash can be eliminated altogether as FASTag enables online deduction.</li><br>
<li>FASTag accounts can be recharged online through Net banking, Credit/Debit card or UPI.</li><br>
<li>A customer can check their statement online by signing in through FASTag customer site.</li></span><br>
<span>As per the statement made by the MoRTH Minister, more than <strong>1.15 crore</strong> FASTag cards have been issued as of <strong>31st December, 2019</strong>. Recent news also declared that approximately 100,000 cards are issued everyday with more than 3 million transactions taking place on a daily basis.</span>
