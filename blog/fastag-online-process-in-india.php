<br><span>

Lots of vehicles are stopped in toll plaza for making toll payments and this creates traffic problems in toll. So in order to stop these traffic situations the government of India has launched the FasTag payment system and made it mandatory for all toll plaza running in India to accept the payment electronically.</span>

<br>

<br><span>

Today in this blog article, we will provide a complete guide on <strong>fastag online process</strong>. So just read the full blog article to understand about it in detail.</span>

<br>

<br>

<h2 class="font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">What is FASTag?</h2>

<br><span>

FASTag is a kind of tag which is placed in the front side mirror of the vehicle for automatic deduction of toll payment in the toll plaza without waiting for any cash transaction. </span>

<br>

<br><span>

This is done through the use of <font color="red">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</font> technology on toll plaza that automatically detect the FASTag on the Widescreen of vehicles passing the toll. This tag is connected with a bank account of a person who owns the vehicle for payment deduction.</span>

<br>

<br>

<h3 class="font-weight-bold"style="font-size:24px">How FASTag works?</h3>

<br><span>
