# How to analyse, check out my repository and use it 
+ First saw index in above, then choose one of the following project you like , in right side you see the folder name were the project is located . At last Just Go that folder , and the index page of the of every folder is index.php.
+ In index you see left side - "description of the project" and (after on) in right side you see "it's location".
+ In one folder you get one type of project, websites (content all of PHP files.) or one webpage . Now just download all the files from that folder and host it
Every folder containing different type of project.
+ Different folder containt different project ,all folder are not same . Which mean all folder contains different file , pattern, pages (PHP), results.
+ Some folder have its own readme.txt because of its critical coding (PHP). So please checkout readme.txt in all folders for more information.
+ All folders have different results because of there different project theme.
